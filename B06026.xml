            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

On our way towards the <hi>Weems,</hi> we took nottice of the Flewry verdant Banks, where we found <hi>Thestylis</hi> the Goddess of Hucksters, occupied in Ramassing of Nettles, who told us they were to serve for the Wedding feast of one of the Aldermans daughters of <hi>Buck-haven,</hi> this news made us make hast toithe place, and so we passed the <hi>Weems,</hi> that we might the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er partcipat of the Solemnities of so glorious a consummation: The Brides here in all Ages having been crackt for their behaviour, our arrival was one hour ere <hi>Phaebus</hi> hot nodled steeds took stable, so we had time enough to survey the cunning situation and fortification of the place, equall to any other of the World: It lyes under the Brow of a steep Brack, so that it is unaccessible towards the Land, without hazard of Necky<hi>'s:</hi> The Sea Guards the other side, the passages at either end are shut up with a Crosse Cart, which done, the Citizens sleeps securely unless you Allarm them with Souldiers. Our Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was splendid, the whole Senate accompanying us in their Robes, which themselves in Modesty Term Bilfangls, not unlike to the Gowns with Velvet necks: And yet this Senate because they have Couls and Robes of the Gray-boddin, they plead them to be more Apostolick then these of the Bombacee. The Town Recorder was very full in a Speech, wherein he shew that the <hi>Arsacides</hi> our Princes Progenitors, had many obligations to their City, that in Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, their City might have the Education of their young Princes, he minding him that when the <hi>Parthians</hi> were likely to be subdued by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that their then Admiral <hi>Davy Downy</hi> relieved them with a Fleet of Oyster-Dreggers: They again when the <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants</hi> of the South Coast would have made Invasion on their Fish Territories, that then they were alwise supplied with Lanciers, strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mounted on Grashoppers from <hi>Caramania:</hi> Thus he shew the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual amity and League twixt the Republique and the <hi>Parthian</hi> Empire. Thus done, we were brought to their Colledge, where we saw the works of the great <hi>Magii,</hi> who treats of all the several Baits for catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>Hence we went to their <hi>Arsenal,</hi> plentifully provided with Hooks Nets, Corks, Leads, Plowters, Creels, and all inventions for ensnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Citizens of the Sea. At length we returned to the Bride, whos: entertainment was stately, of Dudds, Leydocks, Carlins, Orgements and Crowdy-moudy, the Musick was ratling of Shells of all sorts, Flute of Lobstar claws, Dulcimers of Partan bodies, and the Lochq<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

The next morning which we longed much for, having given seeming thanks, we left our <hi>Foay</hi> (you may guesse what it was) for Drink Money, a <hi>Geordy,</hi> each under his own Pillow. We mounted for <hi>Cowper,</hi> where we arrived the night before the great Race, our entertainment there was so substantial, that I dare not mention the reality of it, lest I should seem to Romantize the Nobility, Gentry and Burgers, every one striving who should out do one another in welcoming the Prince. The next day the hour of Solemnity being come, the Court fenced in the Right Honourable the Lord Provost's name and all ceremonies duely performed, the two Horses which were to carry on the Work (the one of Noble <hi>Eliot,</hi> the other of Stout <hi>Murray</hi> brother to the Barron of <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Race of the following day for a Cup of half the proportion of the other, bestowed <hi>gratis</hi> by the Towns heritable Provost, the Noble Earl, and was carried by a Barb of the Baron.</p>
            <p>The third Race for a Sadle of five pound <hi>Sterling</hi> gained by a horse of Mr. <hi>Erskine</hi> Brother to the Noble constantly Loyal <hi>Hero;</hi> This horse though of 28 years of Age, and had known and experienced horses of the Game against him, yet carried the Prize with a high Train. We cannot omit to shew, that during the time of the Usurper, he concealed his abilities as to speed, lest he might have been imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in service against his <hi>Majesty;</hi> as also since <hi>May</hi> 29 last, new Teeth hath sprung in place of the Old ones, so that now he may well pass for a four year old: This was the last day of this Years <hi>Olympiad</hi> at <hi>Cowper</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> which Town shew well who was their Patron by their Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to Strangers, celebrate in the highest measure. All these sportful recreations were carried on by a most pleasant harmony, and a behaviour free of all contests and contradictions, that as I Learned the Mute <hi>Caledonius</hi> who was appointed there as a Judge, had this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that he had heard many Cracks and no Oaths, save in one inconsiderable <hi>Remonstator</hi> P<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
